## Summary

This repository contains the **P**roto-**I**talic to **La**tin dataset. 
It models reflex-etymon relationships between these two languages. 
It also provides a variety of both phonological and non-phonological metadata.
All this is purposed toward work in computational historical linguistics, 
permitting deeper studies of this language pair on a systemic level relative to current findings in historical linguistics. 

### Statistics

The tables below summarize basic statistics of our dataset in its current version.
The first table describes statistics relative to the languages involved in the data.
The second table describes statistics which examine the relationship between the two languages.

| Object         | Latin       | Proto-Italic | All         |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Forms          | 2878        | 2934         | 5812        |
| Phonemes       | 16388       | 19299        | 35687       |
| Phoneme Types  | 31          | 44           | 47          |
| Average Length | 5.69 ± 1.44 | 6.58 ± 1.77  | 6.14 ± 1.67 |

| Measure            | Quantity |
|--------------------|----------|
| Word Error Rate    | .        |
| Phoneme Error Rate | .        |

In the latter table, we use Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER), following Cathcart and Rama (2020).

**[[TODO: clarify to be sure that the exact same algorithms are used; 
if not, then point to our paper or provide some kind of equation visual]]**

**[[TODO: clarify position on whether one or multiple etyma are involved in determining the score presented for a single pair.]]**

## Background

**[[TODO: provide background description]]**

## Contents

This dataset follows the Cross-Linguistic Data Format (CLDF) specification. 
A detailed description generated from the metadata is available in the `data/cldf` folder.

As a high-level overview, the dataset contains six main files and a metadata file. 
We will describe each in turn:
1. `Wordlist-metadata.json`: a JSON file describing the structure of the other tables. 
It was generated by the PyCLDF library (Forkel) automatically.
It specifies what columns can and cannot contain and also denotes relationships between tables 
(*i.e.*, via primary and foreign keys) in a standardized format.
2. `forms.csv`: a CSV file containing information on both Latin and Proto-Italic forms.
Each form is connected with its corresponding language (`Language_ID`), meaning (`Parameter_ID`), 
gloss (`Gloss_ID`, if applicable), and tags (`Tag_ID`, if applicable). 
Its form as a whole (`Form`) and phoneme tokens (`Segments`) are also provided.
3. `cognates.csv`: a CSV file serving to link Latin and Proto-Italic forms in terms of their cognate relationships. 
Each form (`Form_ID`) links with a cognate set ID (`Cognateset_ID`).
4. `languages.csv`: a CSV file which contains basic information about the languages involved in this dataset, 
including languages IDs (`ID`), names (`Name`), approximate locations (`Latitude`, `Longitude`), and linguistic resource codes (`Glottocode`, `ISO639P3Code`).
5. `glosses.csv`: a CSV file which contains information about irregular changes and other special notations for our word forms. 
These are spread across nine categories which serve as booleans. 
These irregularities are generally explained in the `Comment` category,
and we use a tag for that irregularity in square brackets (*e.g.*, `[Analogy]`) to denote a reference to that irregularity type.
6. `tags.csv`: a CSV file which contains morphological information concerning the Latin forms involved in the dataset. 
We provide information such as `Part_of_Speech`, `Inflection_Class`, and a host of other morphological tags. 
7. `sources.bib`: a collection of resources in BibTeX format used in the process of creating this data. 
Keys in any `Source` column of any table of the dataset should cross-reference a key in this file.

**[[TODO: some column specifications can be improved w.r.t. specificity.]]**
**[[TODO: part-of-speech tags remain vague, and the notation used needs to be made clear. 
Might use the codes.csv file from CLDF to store such data and avoid the need to exhaustively explain it.]]**

## Contributing

This repository is intended to provide a single, definitive version of this dataset for future work and research. 
However, if there are issues or mistakes with the data, we would be glad to investigate them. 
Please open an issue to start a conversation on the subject. 

Any future updates of the dataset will be tagged with a version number so as to make it easy to designate and compare results. 
The current version is `v1.0`.

We find that a highly augmented model shows highest accuracy in predicting held-out forms, and investigate other properties of interest learned by our models' representations.
